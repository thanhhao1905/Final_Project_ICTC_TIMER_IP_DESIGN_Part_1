# 64-bit Timer Counter

In modern digital systems, timers and counters are fundamental components that play a crucial role in time measurement, event scheduling, and system synchronization. The **64-bit Timer Counter** presented in this project is a versatile and robust hardware module designed to provide precise timing functionality in embedded systems, System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, and microcontroller applications.

This timer module implements a high-resolution 64-bit counter capable of operating in multiple modes, offering both free-running and periodic counting capabilities. With its configurable prescaler, the timer can adapt to various timing requirements, from high-frequency operations to long-duration measurements. The module incorporates an **Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)** interface, making it compatible with industry-standard ARM-based systems and easily integrable into complex digital designs.

### Key Features
The timer's architecture includes essential features such as:

* **64-bit counter** with programmable compare value for interrupt generation.
* **Multiple operating modes** (free-running and periodic).
* **Programmable prescaler** for clock division (1-256).
* **Debug-mode support** with halt capability.
* **APB 3.0 compliant interface** for easy system integration.
* **Configurable interrupt mechanism** with enable/disable control.
